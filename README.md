# giphy-api

# Project Description
This app utilizes Javascript with JQuery to make an AJAX call to GIPHY's API.<br>

# How to Use
First, open up index.html with your favorite browser,<br>
or access it through: https://daniibooii.github.io/giphy-api/<br>

Then, you'll be able to click on existing buttons to call relevant .gifs,<br>
or enter your own key term to generate new buttons.<br>
Just click to your heart's content.<br>

## Notes
<br>

## Remaining Work
My CSS file still blank; a bit of extra code needs to be plugged in [see notes within project files].<br>
Work is 75-80% complete; I hope to finish it soon, or return to it later.<br>
